I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Human Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu), at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. I'm advised by [Patrick Carrington](https://patrickcarrington.com) and [Andrew Begel](https://andrewbegel.com) and currently am a member of [AXLE Lab](https://axle-lab.com) and [VariAbility Lab](https://cmu-variability.github.io/).

I conduct research at the intersection of accessibility ([A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com)), disability studies, computer vision applications, and [IxD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design) for computer and robotic systems.
